# Emoji Cyclopedia
<hr>

Hello, Welcome to my Repository!

I have created my first application using ReacJs
a javascript library. It's an # Emoji Cyclopedia 
to understand the meaning of a perticular emoji.

We can do it in 2 ways:
1. You can click on the shown emoji and the 
  meaning will come up 
2. You can use emoji itself pasting it in the
  column given and the meaning will shown below 
  of the column

You can try it using the link given:

Thank you!
